Forking a repository
--------------------

Forking is a common concept for a developer. If you have already used a GNU-
Linux-based distribution, you would know that there are some forefathers, such as
Debian, and some derived distro, such as Ubuntu. They are commonly called the
forks of the original distribution.
In GitHub, things are similar. At some point, you will find an interesting open-source
project that you want to modify slightly to perfectly fit your needs. At the same time,
you want to benefit from bug fixes and new features from the original project, all the
time keeping in touch with your work. The right thing to do in this situation is to
fork the project.

However, first, remember that fork is not a Git feature, but a GitHub invention.
When you fork on GitHub, you get a server-side clone of the repository on your
GitHub account. If you clone your forked repository locally in the remote list, you
would find the origin alias that points to your account repository. The original
repository will generally assume the upstream alias (but this is not automatic, you
have to add it manually):
