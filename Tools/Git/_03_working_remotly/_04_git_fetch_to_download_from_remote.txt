Downloading remote changes
--------------------------
The first thing you have to learn when working with remote branches is to check
whether there are modifications to retrieve.
Checking for modifications and downloading them. The git fetch command is very helpful. 
To see it at work, create a new file directly
on GitHub using the following steps so that we can work with it:
1.	 Go to your GitHub dashboard and choose the Pasta branch.
2.	 Click the plus icon on the right-hand side of the repository name to add a new file.
3.	 Add a new empty file, for example, Bucatini-Amatriciana.md , and commit it directly from GitHub:

Now, we can make use of git fetch :
===================================================================
	git fetch
===================================================================

The git fetch command downloads differences from the remote, but does not
apply them. With the help of git status , we will see more details.
As you can see, Git tells us there is one downloaded commit we have to apply to
keep our branch in sync with the remote counterpart.
