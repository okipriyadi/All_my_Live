Now, we have a remote repository, so it's time to learn how to hook(menghubungkan) it locally. For
this, Git provides the git clone command Using this command is quite simple. All we need to know is the URL of the repository
to clone.

To copy the URL, you can simply click on the clipboard button on the right-hand
side of the textbox.
So, let's try to follow these steps together:
1.	 Go to the local root folder, C:\Repos , for the repositories.
2.	 Open a Bash shell within it.
3.	 Type git clone https://github.com/fsantacroce/Cookbook.git .
==========================================================
	git clone [url_xxx.git]
==========================================================

Uploading modifications to remotes
So, let's try to edit the README.md file and upload modifications to GitHub:
1.	 Edit the README.md file using your preferred editor. You can add, for example, a new sentence.
2.	 Add it to the index and then commit.
3.	 Put your commit on the remote repository using the git push command.
==========================================================
	git push
==========================================================

The git push command allows you to upload local work to a configured remote
location, in this case, a remote GitHub repository. There are a few things we have to
know about pushing. We can begin to understand the message Git gave us just after
we run the git push command.
