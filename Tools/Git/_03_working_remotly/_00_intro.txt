A Git remote is another computer that has the same repository you have on your
computer. Every computer that hosts the same repository on a shared network can
be the remote of other computers:
So, a remote Git repository is nothing other than a remote copy of the same Git
repository we created locally. If you have access to that host via common protocols
such as SSH, HTTPS or the custom git:// protocol, you can keep your modification
with it in sync. To start working with a remote, we have to get one. Today, it is not difficult to
get a remote. The world has plenty of free online services that offer room for Git
repositories. One of the most commonly used repository is GitHub

Setting up a new GitHub account
---------------------------------
1.	Go to https://github.com .
2.	Sign up using your e-mail. When done, we are ready to create a brand new repository where we can push our work:
3.  Go to the Repositories tab, click on the green New button, and choose a name for your repository:
4. Then, you can write a description for your repository. This is useful to allow people
who come to visit your profile to better understand what your project is intended
for. We create our repository as public because private repositories have a cost, as we
said earlier. Then, we initialize it with a README file. Choosing this GitHub makes a
first commit for us, initializing the repository that is now ready to use.
