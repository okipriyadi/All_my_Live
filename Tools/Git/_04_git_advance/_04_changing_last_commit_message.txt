This trick is for people who don't double-check what they're writing. If you pressed
the Enter key too early, there's a way to modify the last commit message, using the
git commit command with the --amend option:
===================================================+
	$ git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
===================================================+
Please note that with the --amend option, you are actually redoing the commit, which
will have a new hash; if you already pushed the previous commit, changing the last
commit is not recommended; rather, it is deplorable and you will get in trouble.
