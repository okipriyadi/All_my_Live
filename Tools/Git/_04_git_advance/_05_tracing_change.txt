=======================================
	git blame <filename>

d0dd1f61 command:

The git show command is a multipurpose command, it can show you one or more

The git blame and git show commands have quite a long list of options; the

be traced on a file; you can inspect other possibilities using the ever useful git
<command> --help command.
