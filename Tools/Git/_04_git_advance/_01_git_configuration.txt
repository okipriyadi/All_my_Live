The configuration options are stored in plain text files. The git config command
is just a convenient tool to edit these files without the hassle of remembering where
they are stored and opening them in a text editor.

Configuration levels
---------------------
In Git we have three configuration levels which are:
•	 System
•	 User
•	 Repository
There are different configuration files for every different configuration level.
You can basically set every parameter at every level according to your needs. If you
set the same parameters at different levels, the lowest-level parameter hides the top
level parameters; so, for example, if you set user.name at global level, it will hide the
one eventually set up at system level; if you set it at repository level, it will hide the
one specified at global level and the one eventually set up at system level.

System level
------------
The system level contains system-wide configurations; if you edit the configuration
at this level, every user and its repository will be affected.
This configuration is stored in the gitconfig file usually located in:
•	 Windows - C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\gitconfig
•	 Linux - /etc/gitconfig
•	 Mac OS X - /usr/local/git/etc/gitconfig
To edit the parameters at this level, you have to use the --system option; please
note that it requires administrative privileges (for example, root permission on Linux
and Mac OS X). Anyway, as a rule of thumb, the edit configuration at system level is
discouraged in favor of per user configuration modification.

Global level
-----------------
The global level contains user-wide configurations; if you edit the configuration at
this level, every user's repository will be affected.
This configuration is stored in the .gitconfig file usually located in:
•	 Windows - C:\Users\<UserName>\.gitconfig
•	 Linux - ~/.gitconfig
•	 Mac OS X - ~/.gitconfig
To edit the parameters at this level, you have to use the --global option.

Repository level
-----------------
The repository level contains repository only configurations; if you edit the
configuration at this level, only the repository in use will be affected.
This configuration is stored in the config file located in the .git repository
subfolder:
•	 Windows - C:\<MyRepoFolder>\.git\config
•	 Linux - ~/<MyRepoFolder>/.git/config
•	 Mac OS X - ~/<MyRepoFolder>/.git/config
To edit parameters at this level, you can use the --local option or simply avoid
using any option as this is the default one.

Listing configurations
----------------------
To get a list of all configurations currently in use, you can run the 
=======================================+	
	git config --list [option] 
	eg1: git config --list
	eg2: git config --list --local
	eg3: git config --list --global
	eg4: git config --list --system
=======================================+
if you are inside a repository, it will show all the configurations from
repository to system level. To filter the list, append --system , --global , or --local
options to obtain only the desired level configurations, as shown in the following
