we have created an empty folder and initialized a new repository using the git init command. Starting
from now, we will call this folder the working directory. A folder that contains an
initialized Git repository is a working directory. You can move the working directory
around your file system without losing or corrupting your repository.

Within the working directory, you also learned that there is a .git directory. Let's
call it the git directory from now on. In the git directory there are files and folders
that compose our repository. Thanks to this, we can track the file status, configure
the repository, and so on.

When you create or copy a new file in the working directory, the first state of the
file is untracked. This means that Git sees that there is something new, but it won't
take care of it (it would not track the new file). If you want to include the file in
your repository, you have to add it using the add command. Once it is added, the
state of the file becomes unmodified. It means that the file is new (Git says it is
unmodified because it never tracked changes earlier) and ready to be committed, or
it has reached the staging area (also called index). If you modify a file that is already
added to the index, it changes its status to modified.
