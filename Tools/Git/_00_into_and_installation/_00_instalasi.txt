Git is open source software. you can download it for free :

1. for windows machine:  http://git-scm.com . 
2. for Mac user:         http://git-scm.com/downloads ;
3. for Linux user, you probably have Git out of the box (if not, use the apt- get install git command 
   or equivalent).
 
 -------------------------------  
 Running our first Git command
 -------------------------------
 1. Open a prompt and simply type git (or the equivalent, git --help )
	If Git has been installed correctly, typing git without specifying anything else will
	result in a short help page, with a list of common commands. If not, try reinstalling
	Git, ensuring that you have checked the Use Git from the Windows Command
	Prompt option. Otherwise, Git will be available only within the embedded Bash shell.
