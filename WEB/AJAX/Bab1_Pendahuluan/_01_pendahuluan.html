SYNCHRONOUS 
	Synchronous Ajax is not very common, but it is perfectly valid. You probably won’t use it, but
just in case you hit a situation where you need to, it’s good to know what it is.
Synchronous Ajax means that the Ajax call happens at the same time as all the other requests
in your application. There are positives and negatives to this. Making your Ajax calls synchro-
nous will block the download of other assets until the request completes, which can create a
weird user experience because of some extra-heavy lifting that needs to happen before a page is
completely rendered in the browser.
	On a more positive note, if you can find a way around the slowness, using synchronous Ajax
calls opens up the opportunity to store Ajax data into an object and play around with the
timing of certain functions being executed. If an Ajax call is processing something critical for
the user to the point that you need to block them from doing something while the request is
going on, a synchronous Ajax call may be what you need.

Asynchronous
	Asynchronous Ajax is much more common. You’ll probably use this 99%.  
it’s fairly independent and separated from the rest of the assets in a page or Web application. 
These Ajax interactions happen behind the scenes and don’t really block anything from downloading. 
Even if you’re executing an Ajax call with the onload event, the timing of that is usually 
slightly after the normal page load.
	Asynchronous calls can happen at any point and be triggered by any event ( click , focus ,
blur , touchstart , and so on). The point of them is that they don’t happen in one large chunk
bundled together with the rest of the HTTP requests on a page.
	Using an asynchronous call removes the blocking nature of the synchronous call because the
user can continue to interact with the page in other ways while the request is being processed.

The XMLHttpRequest
The XMLHttpRequest object is the heart of any Ajax call. 
Creating an instance of the XMLHttpRequest is the first step in making an Ajax call, and it’s
pretty easy. 
-->

//Creating an Instance of the XMLHttpRequest
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

Cross-Browser Issues
Microsoft first invented the XMLHttp object that later became the more popular XMLHttpRequest . 
This does cause a bit of an issue because the XMLHttp object is the only Ajax object supported 
in Internet Explorer 5 and Internet Explorer 6. No one supports IE 5 anymore, so we’ll ignore that.
Even though support for IE 6 is falling fast, it’s worth addressing that problem up front.
If someone were to visit your Ajax enabled application with IE 6, it wouldn’t support the
normal XMLHttpRequest object, but rather the older XMLHttp object. It’s a little bit of a pain,
but if you don’t personally support IE 6 in your development process anymore, don’t worry
about it. It’s pretty easy to do a quick support check for the XMLHttpRequest and move on
from there, just in case someone from that rapidly falling market share were to stumble upon
your application.
-->

if ( window.XMLHttpRequest ) { // check for support
	// if it's supported, use it because it's better
	xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
} else if ( window.ActiveXObject ) { // check for the IE 6 version
	// save it to the xhr variable
	xhr = new ActiveXObject("Msxml12.XMLHTTP");
}


<!--
Because this is a very common bit of functionality to have with any Ajax call and will probably
be reused over and over, it is best to save it to a function. You will find similar functions all
over the Web with XMLHttpRequest feature detection.

Because this is a function that passes information into another function, the first
step is to initialize the variable, then run the normal if statement and return the variable so it
can be passed into another function. 
-->

function getHTTPObject() {
	// initialize the variable
	var xhr;
	if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // check for support
		xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	} else if (window.ActiveXObject) { // check for the IE 6 Ajax
		xhr = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
	}
	return xhr;
}
