<!--
The most common events, other than load , that you will use are most likely mouse and
keyboard-based events. What are mouse and keyboard-based events? Events such as

click
focus
blur
change
mouseover (hover part 1)
mouseout (hover part 2)
submit (form submit)

There are a lot of events in JavaScript. Some youâ€™ll probably never use, like double-click. The
previous list contains the popular mouse and keyboard events that I personally use very often
and I imagine you will as well.
