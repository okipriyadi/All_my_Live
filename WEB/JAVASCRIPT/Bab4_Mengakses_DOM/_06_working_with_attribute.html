Now that we have a strong grasp(pegangan/genggaman) of how to work with and target element nodes, 
we can start working within those nodes and play around with the attribute node . 
An attribute is contained inside an element node, but is not considered to be a child of
that node, so we need some special methods to get, modify, or remove that information. Those
methods are

1. getAttribute()
2. setAttribute()
3. removeAttribute()
4. hasAttribute()

In all these methods we target the attribute and return the value, so in an example of
class="visible", we would be targeting “class” and returning the value “visible”.
Getting and changing attributes is paramount to writing a Web application that performs well.
Because many of the most common interactions we create, like hide/show, can be created more
efficiently through CSS, those can be as simple as adding or removing a class. In this example
we will be working with the following HTML shown in Listing 4.6 .
-->


<img src="images/placeholder.png" class="show" alt="placeholder image" id="plc">


<!--
Getting an Attribute
Before we can get an attribute, we need to jump into the DOM at an element node (using one
of the methods we just learned about), and then we can gain access to that element’s attribute.
This is one of the ways we gain more information about an element. The getAttribute()
method takes one argument, which is the name of the attribute you want to target.
Before we target an attribute, much like we did with checking the NodeList length, we want
to make sure an element contains the attribute we’re looking for. This can be done with the
hasAttribute() method. Suppose you want to target the image referenced in Listing 4.6 and
get the class value. The JavaScript in Listing 4.6.1 will illustrate how you might accomplish that
task.
-->

<script>
// first we target the element and check if it has a class on it
if(document.getElementById("plc").hasAttribute ("class")) {
	// after we know a class exists, we can then get the value
	document.getElementById("plc").getAttribute ("class");
	// this would return the value of "show", which is the class on our image
	
	// replace the current class with a value of "hidden" (from “ visible ” to “ hidden ”)
	document.getElementById("plc").setAttribute("class", "hidden");
	// add a new attribute to the image
	document.getElementById("plc").setAttribute ("title", "we moved this element off screen");
	
	//we can then remove it
	document.getElementById("plc").removeAttribute("title");
}
</script>

<!--
You may be well aware that a class exists in the area you’re targeting, but using
hasAttribute() is more of a best practice, just in case it doesn’t exist (it happens). We don’t
have to waste valuable processing time executing the JavaScript for no reason.

With this example, you might consider the following CSS
.visible {
position: static;
}
/* this is applied when our class is changed and moves the image out of view */
.hidden {
position: absolute;
top: -9999px;
left: -9999px;
}

Note
It’s important to not use display: none when working like this in CSS because screen read-
ers cannot view content that is set to display: none . That is why we choose to hide content
like this by simply moving it off the screen.
