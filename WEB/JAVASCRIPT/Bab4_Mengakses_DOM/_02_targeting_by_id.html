<!--
This is a simple HTML snippet consisting of two ID values that we can use to access each
element. Most times you will have natural IDs on your HTML elements (like "header" in the
example) that you can use for targeting, but sometimes you do need to add in extra (or unnatu-
ral) IDs (like "homelink" in the example) to gain quick access to an element node. There are
other ways, but performance-wise, this is the fastest. In Listing 4.2.1 let’s take a look at the
JavaScript you would use to access these nodes.
-->

<!-- targeting by ID -->
<div id="header">
	<h1> <a href="/" id="homelink">Title of your site </a> </h1>
</div>

<!--
JavaScript Used to Access an Element by Its ID
document.getElementById("header");
document.getElementById("homelink");

As I mentioned earlier, you have to access the document object before you can get to the node
you want. After you have access to the node, you can store, modify, or retrieve extra infor-
mation about the element with the plethora of methods built into JavaScript that we will be
exploring throughout this entire book. It’s important to remember that, although we are using
the ID attribute to access the node, we are still accessing the element node and not the attribute
node at this point. If we were to access the content of the ID attribute (the text “ header ” and
“ homelink ”), we would be accessing the attribute node, but since we’re not doing that, we’re
still on the element node.
