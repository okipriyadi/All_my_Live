Because IDs are unique to each document, getElementById() can return only a single
element. Sometimes that just doesn’t fly, and we need more than one, or even a group of
elements. When this is the case, we use getElementsByTagName() in a similar way.
Targeting an element (node) by tag name is another popular method of creating an access
point in the DOM. You can both target a group of elements and a single element inside of a
group if you want. Suppose we have a pretty stripped-down Web page like the one shown in

Note
A pretty common (and frustrating) mistake in JavaScript syntax is not pluralizing the word “ele-
ments” in getElementsByTagName() . Pay close attention to this and you’ll save yourself
some debugging time.

We can grab each paragraph in Listing 4.3 with the single line of JavaScript in Listing 4.3.1 .

document. getElementsByTagName ("p");

This will return a DOM object called a NodeList . A NodeList is a collection of nodes that main-
tain their source order. In other words, it’s a list of elements, and those elements stay in the
same order they appear on the page. 
The order is pretty important because if the items were
randomly shuffled, they would be very difficult to access when we need them.
After we have the NodeList, we will also want to check to see how long it is. Checking its
length will allow us to make sure values are available before we execute a block of script. We
can do this with the length method,  .

==================================================================================================
document. getElementsByTagName ("p").length;
// will return 3
// checking the length before executing script
if(document.getElementsByTagName("p").length > 0) {
// it returns "3", and 3 is greater than "0", so we're good to go.
}
==================================================================================================
So far we have targeted a group of elements and checked their length; after that, we may want
to grab an individual node to do some work on. It’s pretty easy to pull an item out of the
NodeList. There are two ways we can do this:
1. Using the item method
2. Using an array syntax
Both methods will return the same value, so it’s more an issue of personal preference when you
choose the way you want to access elements in a NodeList. Let’s take a look at them both in
example below.
==================================================================================================
// the first paragraph using the item method
document. getElementsByTagName ("p").item(0);
// the first paragraph with array syntax
document. getElementsByTagName ("p")[0];
// the second paragraph with the item method
document. getElementsByTagName ("p").item(1);
// the second paragraph with array syntax
document. getElementsByTagName ("p")[1];
==================================================================================================
Note
NodeLists and arrays start at 0, not 1. So the list looks like 0,1,2,3,4, etc. This is why we are
using 0 in the preceding example to access the first element. If only a single element returns in
the NodeList, you still have to use the [0] value to grab it.

When we put all this code together, you can see a functional JavaScript snippet starting to
get created. So far we’ve targeted a NodeList, checked its length, and accessed the individual
element inside the NodeList. This is a very common thing to do in JavaScript, so let’s see what
it looks like all put together in Listing 4.3.4 .
==================================================================================================
// checking the length before executing script
if(document. getElementsByTagName ("p").length > 0) {
		// it returns "3", and 3 is greater than "0", so we're good to go.
		// let's access some elements with the array syntax
		document. getElementsByTagName ("p")[0];
		document. getElementsByTagName ("p")[2];
}
