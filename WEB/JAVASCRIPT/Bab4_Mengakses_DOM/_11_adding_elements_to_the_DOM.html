creating and inserting a new element is generally a three-step process:
1. Create the element. ===> createElement([tagname])
2. Fill it with content (or leave it blank). ===> createTextNode()
3. Put in the DOM. ===> appendChild() 

First, we need to use the createElement([tagname]) method to create the element. This
method takes one argument, which is the tag name of the element you want to create. When
I say we create the element, it doesn’t actually exist anywhere until we put it in the DOM; it
helps to perceive this method as thinking up an idea. The idea is floating around your head,
but isn’t a physical thing until you put it on paper, tell someone, or build it.

The second step is to add content to your element. You can do this right away, or you can
do it later, but eventually the element will be filled with something; what good is an empty
element? We use the createTextNode() method to do this. It takes one argument, which is a
string of text that will be inserted into the element.

The last step is picking a point in the DOM to insert your new element. We do this with the
appendChild() method. This method takes one argument, which is the completed element
you want to insert. Then, like magic, you’ve created a new element.

We went over creating new nodes earlier in the chapter with the setAttribute() method
because it also can dynamically create nodes in the DOM. Now let’s look at an example of
creating a new element;.

<body>
	<div id="target-area">
		<p id="tagline">Hello World!</p>
	</div>
</body>

<script>
// store the target area to a variable to keep things neat
var targetArea = document.getElementById("target-area");

// create our <p> element
var p = document.createElement("p");

// create a text node inside the <p>, note that we're using a variable "p" here
var snippet = p.createTextNode("this was a generated paragraph");

// insert our generated paragraph into the DOM
targetArea.appendChild(snippet);
</script>


<!--
Hasilnya : 
<body>
	<div id="target-area">
	<p id="tagline">Hello World!</p>
	<p>this was a generated paragraph</p>
	</div>
</body>
