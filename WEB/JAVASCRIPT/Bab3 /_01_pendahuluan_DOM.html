<!--
DOM = Document Object Model.
At its simplest level, the DOM is an outline of the HTML document you are accessing. 
It functions in much the same way that an outline for any document would function—a book, an
article, a grocery list, anything with structure. There are top-level items, items nested under
them, and items grouped in chunks (like pages in a chapter and chapters in a book). These
items are called nodes and every node in the DOM has a relationship to its surrounding nodes.
These relationships, just like in a real-life family, are:

1. Parent
2. Child
3. Sibling

Parents
A parent node is anything that contains other nodes. Is that a little too vague(tidak jelas)? 
For example, a <body> element is the parent of anything contained within it; div tags, 
table elements, headings, everything nested inside counts as a child. The <body> element can 
certainly contain other parents, but to the <body> , they will always be children.

exampe below shows a simple unordered list and keeping with the family theme, they are all
members of my family. In this example, the <UL> is the parent to all the list items because they
are all contained within it.
-->

<!-- the <ul> is the parent element to all the list items -->
<!-- the <li>s are all children (child elements) of the <ul> -->
<!-- each <LI> is a sibling of the other list items, because they're on the same level -->
<ul>
	<li>Joan</li>
	<li>Charlie</li>
	<li>Peter</li>
	<li>Christine</li>
	<li>Anna</li>
	<li>Tim</li>
</ul>

<!--
Children
In the DOM, children are positioned inside parent nodes. exmple above you can see that the
parent <ul> is wrapping all children (child nodes). It’s like a parent giving all the children a
big hug.

Siblings
Siblings, like in real life, are on the same level (without the inherent rivalry). If a parent has
multiple children, they are referred to as siblings . In example above you can see that all the list
items underneath the parent <ul> are on the same level, making them children of the <ul> ,
but also siblings to each other. They can be a child, parent, and sibling all at the same time if
they have children.
