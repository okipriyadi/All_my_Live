/*Anonymous functions are functions that are declared as they are run, and they have no name
assigned to them. Rather than writing a detailed function, like the one in Listing 3.5.6 , you can
use an anonymous function and have it execute immediately when it is run, instead of having
it reference a function elsewhere in your document.
Anonymous functions perform better than a normally defined function because there is
nothing to reference; they just execute when needed. These functions are used only once; they
canâ€™t be referenced over and over. Making something an anonymous function will prevent
the variable being used from slipping into the global scope (the variables are kept local to the
function)*/
