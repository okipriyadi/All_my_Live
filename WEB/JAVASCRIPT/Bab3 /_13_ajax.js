Ajax is the concept of refreshing a part of an HTML document without reloading the entire
page. It is extremely misused, but I assure you that you will learn the proper ways to use this
technology as you read this book ( Chapter 8 , “Communicating with the Server Through Ajax,”
is all about Ajax and server communications).

Ajax is not an acronym; it does not stand for anything. Many think it stands for Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML, but it doesn’t; it’s just a word. Ajax can be synchronous, and it doesn’t
have to be XML. It can be XML, JSON, or even HTML. It’s all about the data you want to pass
to and from the server, in almost any form you want.
