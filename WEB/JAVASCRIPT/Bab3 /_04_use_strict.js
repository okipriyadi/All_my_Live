/*
The “use strict” statement is something you insert into function definitions to make sure
the parser uses stricter rules when executing your script; it’s like using a strict doctype in the
older days of (X)HTML. It’s thought of as best practice now in JavaScript to prevent you from
writing lazy or sloppy code (no offense). At times it can be frustrating trying to catch hard-to-
find errors, but it will help you in the long run write cleaner, more scalable code. We use this
method throughout the book. example below shows a function we use later in the chapter with the
“use strict” statement at the top.

function getFamilyMemberNames() {
	"use strict";
	/* the rest of your function code goes here */
}
