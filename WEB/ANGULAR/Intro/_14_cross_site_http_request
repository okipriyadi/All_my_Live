Requests for data from a different server (than the requesting page), are called cross-site HTTP requests.
Cross-site requests are common on the web. Many pages load CSS, images, and scripts from different servers.
In modern browsers, cross-site HTTP requests from scripts are restricted to same site for security reasons.
The following line, in our PHP examples, has been added to allow cross-site access.


header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
