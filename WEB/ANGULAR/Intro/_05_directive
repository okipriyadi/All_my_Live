<!--
AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.
AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.

AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.

ng-app 		: directive initializes an AngularJS application.
ng-init 	: directive initializes application data.
ng-model 	: directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
ng-repeat	: directive actually clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection.
