The C language is designed to create small, fast programs. It’s
lower-level than most other languages; that means it creates code
that’s a lot closer to what machines really understand.

Computers really only understand one language: machine code, a
binary stream of 1s and 0s. You convert your C code into machine
code with the aid of a compiler.

jadi ada 3 tahapan dalam pebuatan aplikasi menggunakan C:
1. Source 	: You start off by creating a source file. The source file contains 
			  humanreadable C code dan file nya biasanya berakhiran .c .
2. Compile	: You run your source code through a compiler. The compiler checks for errors, 
			  and once it’s happy, it compiles the source code.
3. Output	: The compiler creates a new file called an executable. This file contains machine code,
			  a stream of 1s and 0s that the computer understands. And that’s the program you can run.
			  
C is used where speed, space, and portability are important. Most operating systems are 
written in C. Most other computer languages are also written in C.
