1. Save the code ex: cards.c
2. Compile with gcc cards.c -o cards at a command prompt or terminal.
   ==================================================================
	gcc cards.c -o cards
   ==================================================================
3. Run by typing cards on Windows, or ./cards on Mac and Linux machines.
   If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, the compiler will have created the machine
   code in a file called cards. But on Windows, all programs need to have a
   .exe extension, so the file will be called cards.exe.
