di bagian awal program biasanya ada source berupa:
=================================
int main() {

}
=================================
All C code runs inside functions. The most important function you will
find in any C program is called the main() function. The main()
function is the starting point for all of the code in your program.

The computer will start running your program from the main()
function. The name is important: if you don’t have a function called main(),
your program won’t be able to start.

The main() function has a return type of int. So what does this mean?
Well, when the computer runs your program, it will need to have some way of
deciding if the program ran successfully or not. It does this by checking the return
value of the main() function. If you tell your main() function to return 0, this
means that the program was successful. If you tell it to return any other value,
this means that there was a problem
