Resetting Django migrations in development phase
So you are still developing the application ,you app is not on production yet .In this case deleting the whole database is not a big deal.You can reset the migrations in exactly three steps

1)

Start by droping your database using SQL language if you are using a database system like Posgres or MySQL and you have a database with name mydb

delete mydb;
If you are using sqlite you just need to delete sqlite file which's generally named db.sqlite3

2)

Next you need to go through all migrations folders for each app that belongs to your project and delete the migrations files except for init.py

If you are using a terminal under Linux/MAC you can automate this tedious easilly .For example

find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete
